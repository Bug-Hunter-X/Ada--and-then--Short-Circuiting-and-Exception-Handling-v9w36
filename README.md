This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Ada related to the use of the short-circuiting operator "and then." The included Ada code shows a function `Check_Range` which checks if a number is within a specific range. While seemingly simple, the short-circuiting nature can lead to unexpected exceptions if not handled appropriately. The solution provides an improved version that addresses this potential issue.
